Correlation between the skill ranking players have for individual heroes. 
Skill ranking was judged by the player's winrate of that hero relative to that
heroes' winrate is the same time period. For each hero pair we find all players
who have played both heroes more than 10 times, then we dvotr those players based 
on their winrate with the hero vs the winrate of that hero in the same time
period. Finally we find the correlation between the player's scores with each
hero. Only looked at real matches and ignored each player's first 12 games. 

A word of warning, some of the hero pair only have a handful of non anonomous players
who played both heros show the correlation could be subject to hias variance.
