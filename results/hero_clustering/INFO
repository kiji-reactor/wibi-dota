Match Sequence Numbers: 0 - 227000000
Row number were added with com.wibidata.wibidota.express.AddRowNumbers --size_filter 15
Tuples of the form (player_id, hero_id, percent_played) were extracted using 
com.wibidata.wibidota.express.HeroPicks, then transformed into vectors using 
com.wibidata.wibidota.TuplesToSequenceFile
The I ran kmeans using:
mahout-0.7-cdh4.1.2/bin/mahout kmeans --numClusters 10 --input pick_seq_files --output kmeans_out 
--maxIter 2 --distanceMeasure org.apache.mahout.common.distance.ManhattanDistanceMeasure --clusters clusters --clustering

Finally the results were extracted using 
com.wibidata.wibidota.GetClusters

The result is the heroes clustered by the percent different players played them.
