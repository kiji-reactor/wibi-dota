Looks at a player's winrate depending on if they have one or lost previous games.
For each 'streak' value (mean a player won n games if n is positive or lost -n if n
is negative in a row) we look at how likely it is player' won the following game. 
We then calcualte the average win rate of those vaules. In general the results
seem to indicate that winning losing consecutive games has little effect
on your chance winning your next game. Look only at real matches and 
we ignore player's first 12 matches.
