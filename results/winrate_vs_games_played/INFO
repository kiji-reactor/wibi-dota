Looks at sliding window intervals of game's each player has played and 
calculates the winrate in that interval. Thus, for examples, the value for 
window 2 was found by finding the percent of games all player's won for their 
2-12th real matches and calculating the mean and standard deviation of those 
numbers. If Valve MMR is working ach player will have 50/50 chance of winning 
each game so the winrates should fall into a binomial distribution with 
mean .50 and std 0.16. The results show Valve is able to hit .16 standard 
deviation very quickly and a player's MMR probably stablizes after about 50
games (as the the mean and standard deviation stablize after about 50 games).
The fact the standard deviation is under .16 might indicate MMR is too sensitive
to short term chances so players the lose in a below average way their first of 
the 10 matches have an increased likely hood of winning their following matches.
